This is the exercise repo for the 2019 iCSC, Geneva.

## Exercise 1: SVD
In order to familiarize ourselves with the concept of matrix approximation via Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), 
we apply SVD to images.

## Exercise 2: iTEBD
Imaginary Time Evolution Block Decimation (iTEBD) is an algorithm that minimize the energy of matrix product states.
Although it is not numerically stable, it provides a good starting point to explore other algorithms.
